# Intrusion Detection System

## Abstract
This repository houses the codebase and documentation for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a smart security solution designed to enhance network security by monitoring and responding to unauthorized login attempts and simulated attacks on specified network ports. The IDS works in real-time, promptly alerting administrators to potential threats and providing insights into network activity.

## Objectives
1. Develop a comprehensive IDS to monitor:
   - Multiple incorrect login attempts.
   - Unauthorized access on specified ports within a controlled fake server environment.
2. Generate real-time alerts and notifications in response to detected security breaches.

## Outcomes
The IDS efficiently identifies anomalies in network traffic, such as incorrect login attempts and unauthorized access attempts. It promptly sends real-time alerts, contributing to a more secure network. The system keeps records of incidents, improving its ability to protect against future threats.

## Process Clarity
1. **Open a Port:** Choose and open a port on the honeypot.
2. **Network Configuration:** Isolate the honeypot from the production network.
3. **Monitor for Hacker Attacks:** Implement monitoring to detect connection attempts.
4. **Hacker Attacks the Port:** Respond when a hacker attempts to connect to the port.
5. **Redirect Hacker to Port:** Divert the hacker to the emulated service on the honeypot.
6. **Notify Administrator:** Send an alert or notification to the administrator about the attack.
7. **Collect Attack Data:** Gather information on the hacker's activities.
8. **Analyze Attack Data:** Study the attack data to understand the hacker's tactics.
9. **Take Action:** Decide on actions based on the nature of the attack.
10. **Document Findings:** Keep records of attack details and findings.
11. **Stop:** End the honeypot monitoring and analysis process.
12. **Review and Improve:** Reflect on results and consider adjustments for future deployments.

## Required Tools
1. **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, or another language for developing IDS software.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Wireshark: For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
   - tcpdump: A command-line tool for capturing and analyzing packets.
3. **Database Management:**
   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite: To store and manage data related to network traffic and security events.
4. **Web Development (for user interface):**
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a web framework (e.g., Django or Flask) for a user-friendly interface.

## Methodology
Our methodology covers planning, research, design, data collection, attack simulation setup, network traffic monitoring, real-time alerts, user interface development, testing, deployment, monitoring, and user education. The focus is on developing a comprehensive IDS for network security.

## Project Scope
The project includes developing an IDS to monitor unauthorized login attempts and execute simulated attacks on specified ports. It encompasses user-friendly interfaces, testing, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, user education, security standards adherence, and regular security reports.

## Utility
The IDS scans network traffic for known threats and suspicious activities, promptly notifying IT and security departments of any security issues or threats.

## Conclusion
This project introduces a comprehensive IDS to fortify network security against evolving cybersecurity threats. The system's successful execution will enhance defenses, promote cybersecurity awareness, and contribute to a safer digital environment.
